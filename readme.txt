skolib is a web-based software initially written to manage a local school library, enabling barcode based book management.
It supports two types of libraries, the regular library where students can borrow books individually. This kind of library ususally provides a variety of different titles.
The other possibility is to manage a library which contains many copies of the same title, such as the library to provide school books for the students.

In order to manage several libraries, there is a database containing the various organisations (schools as it is in my case).
Every organisation then needs a database of its own. A sample skolib_basis database is includes as well as a database for an organisation by the name skolib_template.
